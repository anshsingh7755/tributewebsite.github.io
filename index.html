                <h2>Greatest Ruler of Mewar</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Maharana Pratap Singh</b>, popularly known as the Maharana Pratap, 
                    was the 13th Maharana of Mewar known for his valiant and spirited defence 
                    against the Mughal Empire. He was one of the bravest Rajput rulers of India, 
                    who ruled Mewar in Rajasthan for 35 years. While other Rajput rulers accepted 
                    the supremacy of Akbar, he was one of the few rulers in Indian history who stood 
                    firm against the mighty Mughal Empire.This year marks the 482nd birth anniversary 
                    of Maharana Pratap. According to the English calendar, Maharana Pratap Jayanti falls
                     on 9 May. But in India, the warrior king’s birth anniversary is celebrated, as per the 
                     Hindu calendar, on the Tritiya tithi of Jyeshtha’s Shukla Paksha, which falls on 2 June.
                      The day is observed as a public holiday in some states such as Rajasthan, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.
